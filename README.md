# Supercell Analysis Project

This project employs R and its associated packages to analyze user activity and sales data from Supercell's games. The data is extracted from an SQLite database using the RSQLite package, with the database file provided in the 'sample.zip' archive.

The analysis has revealed various actionable patterns and insights that can contribute to informed decision-making. For a detailed overview of the analysis and its insights, refer to the 'Supercell data intern test.pdf' file. The corresponding code for the analysis is available in the 'Supercell.rmd' file.
